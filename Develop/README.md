# Budget-Tracker

## Motivation
With travelers in mind, this application allows users to track withdrawals and deposits with or without an internet connection. That way the user's account balance is accurate even while traveling.

## How to Use


## Task
I was given front-end code and given the task to create the backend that would allow users to enter deposits and expenses offline and also add entries to the database when brought back online.
